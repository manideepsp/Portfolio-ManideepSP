## Professional Summary

Applied AI / ML Engineer with nearly three years of experience spanning data engineering, applied machine learning, and GenAI systems. Strong background in building reliable data pipelines and analytics foundations, followed by hands-on ownership of ML- and LLM-driven systems including RAG pipelines, agentic chatbots, and hyper-personalized learning workflows.

Experienced in taking internal proof-of-concepts from data ingestion and modeling through experimentation, optimization, deployment, and platform integration. My work focuses on building AI systems that are measurable, scalable, and grounded in real product constraints such as latency, cost, and reliability.

## Professional Experience

### Cognine Technologies — Hyderabad, India  
**Applied AI / ML Engineer**  
*April 2023 – Present*

Joined with a data engineering focus and progressively moved into applied ML and GenAI responsibilities as project needs evolved.

### Data Engineering & Analytics Contributions
- Designed and maintained ETL pipelines using Azure Data Factory (ADF) to ingest data from SQL Server and other sources.
- Implemented Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to support scalable transformations, reporting, and downstream ML workloads.
- Performed complex data transformations and aggregations using SQL, including stored procedures for performance optimization.
- Worked with Databricks and PySpark for analytics and experimentation workflows.
- Built and optimized Power BI dashboards for internal stakeholders.
- Added logging, validation, and error-handling mechanisms to improve pipeline reliability.
- Collaborated with analysts and business users to translate reporting needs into reusable data models.

This phase built the data reliability and domain understanding that later enabled ML and GenAI systems.
