  "summary": "Applied AI / ML Engineer with nearly three years of experience spanning data engineering, applied machine learning, and GenAI systems. Strong background in building reliable data pipelines and analytics foundations, followed by hands-on ownership of ML- and LLM-driven systems including RAG pipelines, agentic chatbots, and hyper-personalized learning workflows.\n\nExperienced in taking internal proof-of-concepts from data ingestion and modeling through experimentation, optimization, deployment, and platform integration. My work focuses on building AI systems that are measurable, scalable, and grounded in real product constraints such as latency, cost, and reliability.",
